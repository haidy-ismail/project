***project Our project is a site for selling mobiles. By having a data base on this site, when we open the program, the products on the site are displayed, and there is a login and Signin. There is a feature to shop online and add the product to be bought and the desired quantity, and it can also find out the details of the product and can return it to the list again if he chooses a wrong product. There is Search at the home page if we want to search for a specific product. When registering, there is a registration as a company or registration as a user. The company has the permission to add, delete or modify the number on the site. Finally, there is a chat for customers if the buyer wants to ask about any details of the purchase order or payment or details of the product and so on.
